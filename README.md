In this Python Project we will input images and merge them together to form a better quality fused image.

The Graphic User Interface created using tkinter looks like below:


And using buttons we can select images. On click on a button a file explorer open so that we can select the image of our choice.
After choosing two images we can click on "Fuse and Display Image " button to fuse the images together and get the result output on the screen.
It might take somr time as time depends on the quality of the input images.
